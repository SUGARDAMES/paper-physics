# Paper Physics
1. How the Game Works
    
      Paper Physics is a physics sandbox where everything is made of paper. There is a task mode where you complete a series of tasks and jobs and you unlock many different objects that you can use in the sandbox mode along the way. There is also a sandbox mode where you can do anything you want with the objects you unlock. In the task mode, in order to complete a task and unlock the next one, you have to collect at least 2 stars from the previous level. In both modes, you have a large area you can mess around in. You can pan around your workspace using the middle mouse button (in the futere you will be able to zoom in and out), and you can place objects at your mouse using the number keys, or you can click on the plus buttons and spawn objects at the plus-sign in the center of your screen. You can also slow down, pause time, and set it back to realtime using the buttons in the task bar. If you want to start over or delete all objects in your drawing, click on the X button in the task bar. (In the futere, you can save your drawings, name them, and load them.) By clicking R, you can set the starting rotation of all the objects you place (shown by the plus sign) and pressing T will reset the starting rotation back to normal.
    
2. How the Game is Made
    
      The game engine we are using to create this game is Unity (https://unity.com/). The coding language we use to code the game is C# (Microsift Visual Studio Code, https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/). The objects in the game are 2D images, made using Google Drawings, and paint.net. We also get some images off of the web. For physics objects, in the Unity Editor we add a component to them called "rigidbody".
    
3. Uploading and Platforms
    
      When the game is finished, it will get uploaded on Itch.io (There is a chance that it will be on Steam).
